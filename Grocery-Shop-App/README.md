## Cart Page
On this page, we can view the products we have added to our cart before, and we can remove the products we want to remove by clicking the cross icon. At the bottom of the page is the total price of the products in our cart. The changes we make (such as adding and removing products) will also cause a change in the total price. The "Pay Now" button is not active. By clicking the back icon, we can return to the home page and add more products.
